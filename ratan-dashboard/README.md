ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview:**

Dashboard is a centralized platform designed to monitor user interactions and questions asked across multiple RatanGPT-powered applications. It provides a unified view to track and analyze LLM responses, helping me to understand usage patterns, user behavior, and the effectiveness of AI-driven conversations.

To view conversation history, you must first log in with your Google account.

Once logged in, you'll see all the projects created using RatanGPT.

Select a project and click the 'View' button to access its details.

You can then view the conversation history for the selected project by searching a specific date or choosing a date range to review interactions between RatanGPT and users.
